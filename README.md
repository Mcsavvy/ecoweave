# EcoWeave: Decentralized Community Clean-up Platform

## Overview
EcoWeave is a blockchain-based platform that incentivizes and organizes community clean-up projects using advanced reputation and reward mechanisms on the Stacks blockchain.

## Smart Contract Features

### Advanced Project Management
- Project Creation with Difficulty Levels
- Reputation-based Participation
- Dynamic Reward Calculation
- Comprehensive Proof Submission and Validation

### Project Lifecycle Management
- Flexible Project Proposal System
- Community Member Registration
- Quality-driven Proof Submission
- Community-validated Project Completion

### Key Contract Functions
- `create-project`: 
  - Initiate projects with difficulty levels
  - Set base rewards and project requirements
- `register-for-project`: 
  - Join projects based on reputation
  - Limit project participation
- `submit-project-proof`: 
  - Upload completion evidence
  - Self-rate contribution quality
- `validate-project-proof`: 
  - Community verification of submitted proofs
  - Dynamic reward calculation

## Reputation System
### Enhanced Mechanics
- Comprehensive tracking of user contributions across multiple dimensions
- Multi-factor reputation scoring including:
  - Project completion rate
  - Quality of submitted proofs
  - Community validation impact
  - Consistency of participation
- Dynamic reputation thresholds for project access
- Reputation-based privileges and rewards
- Transparent reputation calculation mechanism

### Advanced Project Difficulty Levels
Our enhanced difficulty system provides a nuanced approach to project classification:

- `PROJECT_DIFFICULTY_EASY`: 
  - Beginner-friendly clean-up projects
  - Lower barrier to entry
  - Shorter duration
  - Basic skill requirements

- `PROJECT_DIFFICULTY_MEDIUM`: 
  - Intermediate complexity projects
  - Requires some prior experience
  - More complex environmental challenges
  - Moderate time commitment
  - Skill-building opportunities

- `PROJECT_DIFFICULTY_HARD`: 
  - Advanced environmental restoration projects
  - Comprehensive skill and commitment requirements
  - Long-term, complex clean-up initiatives
  - Specialized equipment or expertise needed
  - Significant community impact

## Project States
- `PROJECT_STATE_PROPOSED`: Initial project planning
- `PROJECT_STATE_ACTIVE`: Project in progress
- `PROJECT_STATE_COMPLETED`: Validated project completion

## Comprehensive Error Handling
- `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED`: Permission validation
- `ERR_PROJECT_NOT_FOUND`: Non-existent project
- `ERR_INVALID_PROJECT_STATE`: State-based constraints
- `ERR_ALREADY_REGISTERED`: Prevent duplicate registrations
- `ERR_NOT_REGISTERED`: Unregistered user actions
- `ERR_PROOF_ALREADY_SUBMITTED`: Prevent duplicate submissions
- `ERR_INVALID_PROOF`: Proof requirement validation
- `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_REPUTATION`: Reputation-based access control

## Development Specifications
- Language: Clarity Smart Contracts
- Blockchain: Stacks
- Testing Framework: Clarinet
- Comprehensive Test Coverage

## Dynamic Reward Calculation
Our innovative reward system goes beyond traditional linear compensation:

### Key Components of Reward Calculation
- Base reward determined by project difficulty
- Multipliers based on:
  - Individual reputation score
  - Quality of submitted proof
  - Community validation rating
  - Project impact and environmental significance
- Real-time reward adjustment
- Transparent and fair compensation model

### Reward Calculation Formula
`Final Reward = Base Reward * (Reputation Multiplier) * (Quality Score) * (Impact Factor)`

## Future Roadmap
- Implement machine learning for reward optimization
- Develop cross-platform reputation tracking
- Create advanced environmental impact metrics
- Expand reward mechanisms to include:
  - Carbon credit integration
  - Skill-based token bonuses
  - Community achievement recognitions
- Develop mobile application for real-time tracking
- Implement NFT-based achievement and contribution system
- Explore interoperability with global environmental platforms
